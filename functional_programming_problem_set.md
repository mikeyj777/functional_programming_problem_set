# Functional Programming Practice Problems

## Getting Started with Basic Operations
1. Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with each number doubled.

2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array.

3. Create a function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array containing only the strings that are longer than 5 characters.

4. Write a function that takes an array of objects with a 'price' property and returns the total cost.

5. Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only unique values.

## Combining Operations
6. Write a function that takes an array of numbers, doubles them, and then sums only the doubled numbers that are greater than 10.

7. Create a function that takes an array of objects with 'name' and 'score' properties, and returns an array of names of people who scored above 80, sorted alphabetically.

8. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the product of all positive numbers.

9. Create a function that takes a string and returns an object showing the frequency of each character (ignore spaces and punctuation).

10. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the second largest unique value.

## Mathematical Problems
11. Create a function that finds the sum of all Fibonacci numbers below a given limit that are even.

12. Write a function that finds all pairs of numbers in an array that sum to a given target.

13. Create a function that generates the first n prime numbers using functional programming concepts.

14. Write a function that finds the sum of proper divisors for a number and determines if it's a perfect number.

15. Create a function that finds all triplets of numbers in a range that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

## Advanced Concepts
16. Implement a basic Maybe monad for handling null checks in a functional way.

17. Create a function composition utility that can handle any number of functions.

18. Implement a memoization function that can cache results of pure functions.

19. Create a curried function that can perform matrix multiplication.

20. Implement a basic Either monad for handling errors in a functional way.

Each problem should be solved using functional programming principles, avoiding mutations and side effects.
